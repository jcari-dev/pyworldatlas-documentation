Contributing
============

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **pyworldatlas**. 

At this time, **pyworldatlas** is a personal project, and I am not accepting any external contributions. The goal is to fully complete the package before opening it up to collaboration. 

Once the project reaches a stable and complete state, I will provide detailed guidelines for contributing, including coding standards, issue reporting, and feature requests.

Stay tuned for updates! In the meantime, feel free to use the package and provide feedback via the `GitHub Issue Tracker <https://github.com/yourrepo/pyworldatlas/issues>`_.

Thank you for your understanding!
