Roadmap
=======

The development of **pyworldatlas** is ongoing, with a focus on building a comprehensive and reliable package of country data. Below is the current plan for the package's growth.

Data Collection Approach
------------------------
The data collection for **pyworldatlas** is done manually. This process is not automated because I want to take the time to personally learn about each country. This ensures that the data is carefully curated and accurate while providing me with a deeper understanding of global information.


Goals and Focus Areas
---------------------

**Data Collection**
- **Ongoing**: Adding new countries to the database. The aim is to add around 5 countries per week, though this may vary depending on the complexity and availability of data. Each country requires careful compilation, as information does not always follow a consistent format.
- **Target**: Aim for steady progress toward complete global coverage.

**Package Core Enhancements**
- **Ongoing**: Improve and refine the core methods for retrieving and processing country data.
- **Short-Term**: Implement a quick access method for retrieving the Wikipedia article revision ID for each country.
- **Mid-Term**: Further optimize performance, especially regarding database queries.

**Progress Visualization**
- **Planned**: Introduce a visual representation of package progress, such as a bar or graph comparing the expected number of countries to be added versus the actual number of countries in the database. This will be updated periodically to reflect the progress.

Future Plans
------------

As the package evolves, there may be opportunities to introduce additional features and optimizations. However, the current priority remains:
1. **Completing the country dataset**.
2. **Improving the performance and usability of the package**.

Once the dataset is nearing completion, additional goals such as opening the package for contributions and expanding the documentation will be considered.

Thank you for following the development of **pyworldatlas**. Stay tuned for updates!
